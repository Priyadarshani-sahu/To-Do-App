Add tasks with a title
View all tasks with their status (completed or incomplete).
Mark tasks as completed.
Delete tasks when no longer needed.
Persist tasks in a JSON file using the Gson library, so tasks remain saved between sessions.
The project demonstrates key concepts in Java programming such as:
Object-oriented programming (using Task class)
File handling and data persistence
Using external libraries (Gson) for JSON serialization
User input and console-based menu interaction
